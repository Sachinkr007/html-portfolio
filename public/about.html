<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>As a person, I have had a lot of success and I have had a lot of failures as well. All of these experiences have taught me the importance of rising again and striking again in order to succeed. My hobbies are painting, reading, and dancing. Nothing makes me happier than reading. Among the things I enjoy reading the most are novels and history books. There is a small part of me that is fascinated by online gaming. It is rare that I play games on my personal computer or mobile device.

  There are many people who dream of becoming doctors or lawyers, but I have always had a dream of becoming a writer. Since childhood, I was keenly interested in reading books and creating imaginative stories. I donâ€™t know when this passion is converted into my ambition. There has always been a strong support system from my parents when it comes to my dreams and ambitions.</p>
